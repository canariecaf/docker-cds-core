## A Central Discovery Service 

A [Docker](http://docker.com) image for an 'as is' base of the  [v1.20.2 SWITCHwayf](https://forge.switch.ch/projects/wayf) built on Ubuntu 14.04.

This image uses Supervisord the daemon to allow 2 processes to run

- apache2
- a cron daemon


The image is purposely configured clean with an simple configuration for SWITCHwayf with options to permit derivations to choose what they customize.



## To Build the image

### The variables & their defaults

Environment variables with their defaults if they do not exist are:
- CDS_AGGREGATE - the aggregate to point at and ingest via the cron command
	-- defaults to: https://caf-shib2ops.ca/CoreServices/caf_metadata_signed_sha256.xml
- CDS_HTMLROOTDIR - the HTML root directory of the webserver
	-- defaults to: /var/www/html
